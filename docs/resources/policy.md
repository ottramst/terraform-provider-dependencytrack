# dependencytrack_policy (Resource)

Manages a Dependency-Track policy. Policies are used to automatically audit components based on specific criteria and trigger alerts or fail builds.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dependencytrack_policy" "example" {
  name            = "Critical Vulnerabilities"
  operator        = "ALL"
  violation_state = "FAIL"

  conditions = [
    {
      subject  = "SEVERITY"
      operator = "IS"
      value    = "CRITICAL"
    },
    {
      subject  = "LICENSE"
      operator = "IS"
      value    = "GPL-3.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the policy

### Optional

- `conditions` (Attributes List) List of policy conditions that must be met (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions))
- `operator` (String) The operator to use when evaluating conditions (ALL or ANY). Default: ALL
- `violation_state` (String) The violation state (INFO, WARN, or FAIL). Default: INFO

### Read-Only

- `global` (Boolean) Whether this is a global policy. This field is read-only as the Dependency-Track API always sets it to true and does not support changing it.
- `id` (String) The UUID of the policy (same as uuid)
- `include_children` (Boolean) Whether the policy applies to child projects. This field is read-only as the Dependency-Track API does not support setting it.

### Nested Schema for `conditions`

Required:

- `operator` (String) The operator for the condition (IS, IS_NOT, MATCHES, NO_MATCH, NUMERIC_GREATER_THAN, NUMERIC_LESS_THAN, NUMERIC_EQUAL, NUMERIC_NOT_EQUAL, NUMERIC_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, NUMERIC_LESSER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, CONTAINS_ALL, CONTAINS_ANY)
- `subject` (String) The subject of the condition (AGE, COORDINATES, CPE, LICENSE, LICENSE_GROUP, PACKAGE_URL, SEVERITY, SWID_TAGID, VERSION, COMPONENT_HASH, CWE, VULNERABILITY_ID, VERSION_DISTANCE, EPSS)
- `value` (String) The value to compare against

Read-Only:

- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the condition

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Policies can be imported using their UUID
terraform import dependencytrack_policy.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
